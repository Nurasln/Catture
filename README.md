In an old, dark neighborhood, a cat was wandering silently. As it stepped under the flickering streetlights, an elderly woman suddenly appeared. She wore a black, tattered dress, holding an old broom in her hand. It seemed as though she had glided in on her broomstick, floating eerily close; the cat puffed up its fur, unable to believe its eyes.

The cat took a frightened step back, but it couldn’t tear its gaze away. The old lady had a strange smile on her face, and her eyes gleamed unsettlingly in the dark.

 "Tonight, we’ll share ancient secrets." she whispered.

The cat suddenly felt a strange pull, an urge it couldn’t resist, and began moving toward her. The neighborhood was whispering its dark secrets into the night…
